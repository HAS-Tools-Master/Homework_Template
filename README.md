# This repo is for you to use for your homework assignments
I setup a template for you of what this might look like but you can re-arrange and edit this however you want.

Note that the only fonder I will use for grading are items that are put in the `Homework_Submissions` folder. You can use the `Homework_Working`folder to do your work and I will not review anything in that folder. 

Items in the `Homework_Submissions` folder should always be labeled clearly with the homework assignment number in the folder.
