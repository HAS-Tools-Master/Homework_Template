# This repo is for you to use for your homework assignments
I setup a template for you of what this might look like but you can re-arrange and edit this however you want.

The only thing you should not change is your Submission  folder. This is where you  will put assignments you want me to grade. They should always be labeled clearly with the homework assignment number in the folder.
